                        <p>He's the guy with a passion. After years of thinking that Monopoly had a good idea with a
                            terrible
                            execution, he found happiness when bumping into his first modern board game store during a
                            trip.
                            From then on, life would have a sole goal.</p>
                        <p>Years later, he had amassed a healthy (or so he tells his therapist) collection of almost 300
                            board
                            games.
                            From the smallest, quickest card games to the largest behemoths, his collection has it all.
                            And,
                            for everybody's happiness, that's the board game club's collection!</p>
                        <p>Don't let his mighty beard fool you: he is a nice guy and even nicer when talking about board
                            games. Do you need someone to explain to you any obscure rule in a game? He's your guy.</p>
                        <p>Just don't ever asks him to share his food. Ever.</p>

                            in love with board games after falling in love with him.</p>

                            a
                            chance and introduced her
                            to the heavier stuff. And thus a monster was created!</p>
                        <p>Need someone passionate about the thinky, heavier board games? She's your girl. From the
                            light
                            (or so
                            she says) Brass to the heavier 18XXs, she will carry those mighty beasts of games like it's
                            nothing. And she'll show you how fun they are (even if they do put you into a coma after a
                            session).
