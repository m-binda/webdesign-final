                    Welcome to the Anima Mundi Board Game Club!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This club, which, operates in Vitória, ES, Brazil, will
                    be your next stop for a fun hobby to play with family and friends (old or new!). We are a club
                    dedicated to modern board games (so forget about old, boring Monopoly and Risk), which will take you
                    to the next level of fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This club is a not-for-profit organization headed by
                    <a href="about_us.html">
                        some very nice people
                    </a>
                    who are just passionate about this hobby. Our goal is to be a safe place for hobbyists new and old
                    (age and experience-wise).
                    So not worries you have never played a modern board game: we've got you covered!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our quite huge collection, we've got games for all tastes and ages. You have kids and want
                    them to have a very fun activity for the afternoons? We hold special events for our little ones in
                    the afternoons. You are an old-timer, thirsty for heavy games (yeah, even those 18XX games)? Do not
                    worry: we have our monthly event for those heavy boxes to get dusted. Oh, yeah, and we do have
                    snacks in the house.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, again, welcome to our amazing Anima Mundi club! We are looking forward to seeing you here.
                </p>
