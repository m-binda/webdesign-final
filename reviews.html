                    <p>
                        One of the heavier titles in our collection has actually pretty simple rules. Food Chain
                        Magnate
                        (FCM) put in the role of an owner of a fast food restaurant chain against up to 3 other
                        players.
                        The
                        game uses cards to build the structure of your company, from the waitresses and chefs to the
                        CEOs
                        and CFOs. Each round, you try to undercut your opponents offering the food your customer
                        wants
                        at
                        the lowest price. Oh, and you also advertise this food to your customers, so they want it in
                        the
                        first place. The winning condition is pretty simple: the wealthiest player wins. The rules
                        can
                        be
                        explained in under 20 minutes but the strategies you can knit together in this game are
                        outstanding.
                        Better for groups of strategists but highly suitable for anyone wanting to go a bit deeper
                        in
                        the
                        heavier side of the hobby without spending a day playing the same game.

                        Wow, how can we describe this game? In Twilight Imperium 4th Edition (TI4), you choose one
                        of
                        the
                        available races (which are all very creative and play very differently) with the goal to
                        conquer
                        the
                        galaxy. This game has it all. Do you want to make trade deals? Done. Do you want to focus on
                        technological research? Done. Do you want to go the diplomatic route? Done. Or do you want
                        to
                        just blow your friends out of the board? Also done. Featuring a variety of strategies, this
                        games
                        defines what a space opera board game is. The only downside: you can put aside at least one
                        hour
                        per
                        player for this game. Well, perfection does take time to flourish.

                    <p>
                        In Mombasa, the player assumes the role of an explorer in Africa during the period between 1881
                        and
                        1914. The game has amazing mechanics, with the main goal being to amass the greatest wealth
                        among
                        players. To do that, you invest in companies which operate in the continent and help them grow.
                        Be
                        careful though: the companies are not yours, so you can inadvertently help your opponents.

                    <p>
                        Mombasa is a great game from a great designer (Alexander Pfister), but, unfortunately, we must
                        point out that the theme chosen for the game was quite an insensitive one. Based on the
                        "Scramble
                        for
                        Africa" period, the game, albeit very lightly, touches the subject of British colonialism in
                        Africa
                        without much reckoning or consideration. We still recommend the game for its amazing mechanisms,
                        but we do incentivize players to deepen their knowledge on the subject. For that, you can check

                        So you love video games like Baldur's Gate and Divinity: Original Sin 2 but you feel like
                        sharing
                        the experience with other people? Well, we've got you covered. Gloomhaven, an amazing fantasy
                        game
                        from Isaac Childres, does just that. With an assortment of new races and classes, the game
                        accommodates 1 to 4 players in a campaign across its original - and quite creative - world. You
                        will
                        strategize with friends and level up your characters just like you would do in the video games
                        of
                        yore, but with the added tactile pleasure of handling amazing minis in a real cardboard map.

                    <p>
                        Lisboa, the beautiful Portuguese capital, has a tragic past only known by history buffs: in
                        1755,
                        the city suffered a powerful earthquake, which destroyed most of the city. The earthquake, which
                        was
                        bad enough, was followed by fires all over the city and, unbelievably, a tsunami. After all
                        that,
                        King Joseph I of Portugal summoned the brilliant Marquis of Pombal to rebuild the city. In this
                        game, you help those historical figures to rebuild Portugal to its former glory. An amazing
                        game,
                        historically accurate, Lisboa is perfect for strategists, as a good Vital Lacerda game always
                        is.

                    <p>
                        If you're dreaming of building castle in France, we'll have to admit it: there are no castle or
                        even
                        Burgundy here. Nonetheless, The Castles of Burgundy, is a sweet, short game for all. True, the
                        theme
                        does not shine here (one can say it doesn't even exist) but the mechanisms of the game are
                        brilliant
                        enough for multiple plays of one of Stefan Feld's most inspired games to date. Quick to
                        understand
                        and to play, the game finishes in around 2 hours and it is great for players aiming for medium
                        Euros.

                        If you feel more inclined towards thematic games, Robinson Crusoe is an amazing one. In this
                        game,
                        Ignacy Trzewiczek managed to make us feel like Crusoe himself, lost and desperate in an
                        unknown
                        island. Not really a fan of the guy? No worries, as Mr. Trzewiczek gives us multiple other
                        scenarios. In a certain expansion, you even get to follow Darwin in its expedition in the
                        Galapagos
                        Islands. A very hard game, you play cooperatively with up to three other people. After 3 or
                        4
                        hours,
                        you and your friends will have impressive survival stories to tell.

                        An apparently simple card game, Mottainai, from the legendary Carl Chudyk, shows us quickly how
                        amazingly complex it can be. The rules are not easy to grok, but once learned, are quite simple
                        and elegant. With an artwork that evokes the best Japanese scenes, Mottainai, meaning roughly
                        "don't
                        waste", has a depth only properlly understood after multiple plays. So in your first game you
                        took
                        an hour to win? Well, your opponent might snatch that second one within 15 minutes with clever
                        plays. Depending just a bit on luck, Mottainai shows, at every play, how amazingly strategic it
                        can
                        be. Is it the Go of card games? Well, we'll let you know after we play a couple more times...
