                            One of the heavier titles in our collection has actually pretty simple rules. Food Chain
                            Magnate
                            (FCM) put in the role of an owner of a fast food restaurant chain against up to 3 other
                            players.
                            The
                            game uses cards to build the structure of your company, from the waitresses and chefs to the
                            CEOs
                            and CFOs. Each round, you try to undercut your opponents offering the food your customer
                            wants
                            at
                            the lowest price. Oh, and you also advertise this food to your customers, so they want it in
                            the
                            first place. The winning condition is pretty simple: the wealthiest player wins. The rules
                            can
                            be
                            explained in under 20 minutes but the strategies you can knit together in this game are
                            outstanding.
                            Better for groups of strategists but highly suitable for anyone wanting to go a bit deeper
                            in
                            the
                            heavier side of the hobby without spending a day playing the same game.

                            Wow, how can we describe this game? In Twilight Imperium 4th Edition (TI4), you choose one
                            of
                            the
                            available races (which are all very creative and play very differently) with the goal to
                            conquer
                            the
                            galaxy. This game has it all. Do you want to make trade deals? Done. Do you want to focus on
                            technological research? Done. Do you want to go the diplomatic route? Done. Or do you want
                            to
                            just blow your friends out of the board? Also done. Featuring a variety of strategies, this
                            games
                            defines what a space opera board game is. The only downside: you can put aside at least one
                            hour
                            per
                            player for this game. Well, perfection does take time to flourish.

                            In Mombasa, the player assumes the role of an explorer in Africa during the period between
                            1881
                            and
                            1914. The game has amazing mechanics, with the main goal being to amass the greatest wealth
                            among
                            players. To do that, you invest in companies which operate in the continent and help them
                            grow.
                            Be
                            careful though: the companies are not yours, so you can inadvertently help your opponents.

                            Mombasa is a great game from a great designer (Alexander Pfister), but, unfortunately, we
                            must
                            point out that the theme chosen for the game was quite an insensitive one. Based on the
                            "Scramble
                            for
                            Africa" period, the game, albeit very lightly, touches the subject of British colonialism in
                            Africa
                            without much reckoning or consideration. We still recommend the game for its amazing
                            mechanisms,
                            but we do incentivize players to deepen their knowledge on the subject. For that, you can

                            So you love video games like Baldur's Gate and Divinity: Original Sin 2 but you feel like
                            sharing
                            the experience with other people? Well, we've got you covered. Gloomhaven, an amazing
                            fantasy
                            game
                            from Isaac Childres, does just that. With an assortment of new races and classes, the game
                            accommodates 1 to 4 players in a campaign across its original - and quite creative - world.
                            You
                            will
                            strategize with friends and level up your characters just like you would do in the video
                            games
                            of
                            yore, but with the added tactile pleasure of handling amazing minis in a real cardboard map.

                            Lisboa, the beautiful Portuguese capital, has a tragic past only known by history buffs: in
                            1755,
                            the city suffered a powerful earthquake, which destroyed most of the city. The earthquake,
                            which
                            was
                            bad enough, was followed by fires all over the city and, unbelievably, a tsunami. After all
                            that,
                            King Joseph I of Portugal summoned the brilliant Marquis of Pombal to rebuild the city. In
                            this
                            game, you help those historical figures to rebuild Portugal to its former glory. An amazing
                            game,
                            historically accurate, Lisboa is perfect for strategists, as a good Vital Lacerda game
                            always
                            is.

                            If you're dreaming of building castle in France, we'll have to admit it: there are no castle
                            or
                            even
                            Burgundy here. Nonetheless, The Castles of Burgundy, is a sweet, short game for all. True,
                            the
                            theme
                            does not shine here (one can say it doesn't even exist) but the mechanisms of the game are
                            brilliant
                            enough for multiple plays of one of Stefan Feld's most inspired games to date. Quick to
                            understand
                            and to play, the game finishes in around 2 hours and it is great for players aiming for
                            medium
                            Euros.

                            If you feel more inclined towards thematic games, Robinson Crusoe is an amazing one. In this
                            game,
                            Ignacy Trzewiczek managed to make us feel like Crusoe himself, lost and desperate in an
                            unknown
                            island. Not really a fan of the guy? No worries, as Mr. Trzewiczek gives us multiple other
                            scenarios. In a certain expansion, you even get to follow Darwin in its expedition in the
                            Galapagos
                            Islands. A very hard game, you play cooperatively with up to three other people. After 3 or
                            4
                            hours,
                            you and your friends will have impressive survival stories to tell.

                            An apparently simple card game, Mottainai, from the legendary Carl Chudyk, shows us quickly
                            how
                            amazingly complex it can be. The rules are not easy to grok, but once learned, are quite
                            simple
                            and elegant. With an artwork that evokes the best Japanese scenes, Mottainai, meaning
                            roughly
                            "don't
                            waste", has a depth only properlly understood after multiple plays. So in your first game
                            you
                            took
                            an hour to win? Well, your opponent might snatch that second one within 15 minutes with
                            clever
                            plays. Depending just a bit on luck, Mottainai shows, at every play, how amazingly strategic
                            it
                            can
                            be. Is it the Go of card games? Well, we'll let you know after we play a couple more
                            times...
