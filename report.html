    <h1>Report: Large Coursework</h1>

    <h2>Student details</h2>
    <p>Name: Marcelo Binda Alves</p>
    <p>(the name was requested in the report specification)</p>


    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>For this assignment, I decided to make a website for a non-existing board game club, which I called Anima Mundi
        Board Game Club As my current position does not allow me to offer services to third parties, this solution was
        obligatory. </p>

    <p>Based on the structure of researched websites with similar content, it was clear that the club’s website should
        present a main page, with introductory content; a events page, with the agenda of current events and images from
        past events; a game reviews page, with written and video reviews for users to see; a membership page, with the
        description and prices of possible memberships; an about us page, with more information about the owners; and a
        COVID-19 guidelines, due to our current global situation.</p>

    <p>All written content and the photos in the about us page are my own. All the other images were downloaded from the
        Internet, from sites which allow this usage. The sources are mentioned at the bottom of this report. The logos
        for the website were made with Adobe Spark Logo Maker (https://spark.adobe.com/express-apps/logo-maker/).</p>

    <p>Although the rubric requested five pages, I decided to make an extra COVID-19 guidelines page. Considering the
        structure of the website, none of the pages could be removed in order for it to make sense. In case it is not
        possible to grade this assignment for all pages, please consider the following HTML pages: index, events,
        reviews, membership and about_us.</p>


    <h2>Comments on the pages</h2>

    <p>The website’s main page presents the introduction to the website, a list of most played games and a map leading
        to the club’s address. The main content of this page, which is the welcome text, remains always at the center of
        the viewer’s attention: for computers, this means the content is placed in the middle of the screen; for mobile
        users, the content is placed on top of the page.</p>

    <p>I also added a mockup map, obtained according to the instructions from Google [1]. Unfortunately, it is not
        possible to generate a working map without paying for a membership.</p>

    <p>In the event page, I included an explanation of the current events held at the club and a gallery with the past
        events and some board game images. The gallery has thumbnails of the images, each allocated to a square of the
        same size, and each image reacts when the user hovers the cursor over them, so the user knows it is possible to
        open them. Once clicked, the image opens over the whole page. For ease of navigation, I decided to allow the
        user to close the image both by clicking the X in the corner or by pressing the ESC key in the keyboard. The
        gallery also rotates, going from the last to the first image and vice-versa.</p>

    <p>For the game review page, I included subsections for written and video reviews separately. This was done in order
        to keep the page’s length at a manageable size for the user. The buttons used to choose between the sections are
        each colored and positioned in a way to act as tabs for the content below, thus making it easier for the user to
        understand their purpose.</p>

    <p>The articles of the written reviews and the videos all adjust properly to the screen size of the users. The
        videos are also embedded in the page, thus making it possible to play them in loco.</p>

    <p>The last three pages have simpler, more direct content. In the membership page, I added both the description of
        each membership type and a form for the user to contact the club about membership options. The about us page
        contains a photo of the owners, the club’s pet and a “new player”, a short, playful description of them, and a
        larger photo at the bottom to illustrate the “family” feeling the club aims to pass. Finally, the COVID
        guidelines page contains basic instructions and rules for the club at this moment</p>


    <h2>Inspirations</h2>

    <p>In order to better assess the needs of the website, I researched other board-game related pages, such as Shut Up
        and Sit Down (https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/), The Dice Tower (https://www.dicetower.com/), Strategy & Board
        Games Club of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania
        (https://groups.wharton.upenn.edu/strategygames/home/) and Board Game Club (https://www.boardgameclub.net/).
    </p>

    <p>The Board Game Club was particularly helpful at choosing the content that could be expected at a website like
        this. Their gallery with past events was a direct inspiration for the gallery at my website. Their website also
        allowed me to avoid some pitfalls. I considered their gallery too packed and crowded, which did not allow the
        user some room to rest their eyes (which I consider mandatory for ease of use).</p>

    <p>The color palette for the website was obtained at Coolors (https://coolors.co/), which inspired me to choose a
        more vivid palette, with enough contrast for all users.</p>


    <h2>Accessibility</h2>

    <p>The website presents an accessible font (no serifs or peculiar font types), with reasonable sizing for all
        content. The colors also have deeper contrast, in order to make it easier for color-blind users. Finally, the
        form and images are all correctly labeled, with the images having a complete description in the HTML pages.</p>


    <h2>Usability</h2>

    <p>The website was designed to be easy to navigate for any user. From the various choices made to make this
        possible, the following three can be highlighted:</p>

    <p>- The website reacts properly to different screen sizes and the contents stay readable. This is particularly
        notable in the collapsible hamburger menu and the gallery, which moves the navigation arrows to the bottom of
        the screen. It was also interesting to design a different, more vertical logo for mobile users, so it fits
        better the screen, which was accomplished using JavaScript.</p>

    <p>- All clickable content reacts to the users when they hover the cursor over them. This is particularly clear in
        the main menu, for both large and small screen users, and the Articles and Videos tabs in the game reviews page.
        For mobile users, all clickable content remains obvious, as their functions are always clear on the page.</p>

    <p>- The game reviews page splits the content in two subsections, so the user does not need to scroll too much to
        access it.</p>


    <h2>Learned skills</h2>

    <p>As this is the first time I build a website from scratch, every skill was learned in order to be able to do it.
        The main skills I can underline are:</p>

    <p>- The gallery in JavaScript. Although there are many examples available online, I realized that I had enough
        understanding of coding to be able to design it basically from scratch. Linking the code to the DOM was the
        hardest part, as I had to learn more about how the DOM works and how it interacts with programming languages.
    </p>

    <p>- CSS positioning and resizing. It was particularly difficult for me to understand how to position the items on
        the
        screen. Taking my experience from our first assignment, it was possible to understand generally simpler ways to
        achieve a correct positioning, without so much micromanagement of the values. After studying more about grid and
        flex layouts, I was able to achieve a more harmonic and fluid experience for the user on all screen sizes.</p>

    <p>- HTML structure. It was particularly useful to better understand the structure and its function in the HTML
        files.
        I was able to better organize the content in the page and better split the correct sections. For this
        assignment, I believe it would be easier for another coder to continue my work without much trouble, due to a
        clearer and functional structure and better comments.</p>


    <h2>What worked well</h2>

    <p>The gallery was the most successful part of the website. As mentioned before, although there are multiple
        examples online on how to make a gallery using JavaScript, it was necessary to do it from scratch, as the
        examples did not achieve what I was aiming for. After multiple tests, the gallery function as any user would
        expect, remaining pleasant looking at all screen sizes, opened or closed. The way it was designed, it can also
        have multiple images added to the HTML without altering anything in the CSS or the JavaScript files.</p>

    <p>The game reviews page also works really well. It was possible to design a tab structure without much effort and
        with simple JavaScript coding. The decision to make the subsections as tabs allows the user to navigate it
        without effort and without having to think about the website structure, which was my main goal here. It also
        makes the website shorter, which prevents too much scrolling.</p>


    <h2>Possible improvements</h2>

    <p>If I was allowed more time, I would invest more time in researching color palettes and web design choices for a
        more pleasant and professionally looking website. Although the website works well and its code is functional, it
        is noticeable that it would benefit from more experience in the designing side of it, especially for the color
        choices and the logo design.</p>
